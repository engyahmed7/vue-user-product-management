Sure, here's a basic README file for your Vue.js user and product management system:

# Vue User and Product Management System

This is a Vue.js application for managing users and products. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on both users and products.

## Features

- **User Management**: Add and delete users. Users can be categorized as admins or regular users.
- **Product Management**: Add, edit, and delete products. Each product has a title, description, price, and thumbnail.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js**: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **Vue Router**: Official router for Vue.js, used for routing within the application.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **JSON Server**: Fake REST API for simulating a backend server for product data.
